  **Sure**

## Beginners Guide to Big O Notation

**Big O notation** is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used

- **O(1)** describes an algorithm that will always execute at the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

- **O(N)** describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

- **O(N²)** represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set

- **O(2^N)** denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input

## Names and Values in Python

Assignment never copies data and this is known as **mutable aliasing**

Change is unclear, changing an integer act as **rebinding** while changing a list act as **mutating**.
